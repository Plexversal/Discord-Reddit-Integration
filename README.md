# Discord-Reddit-Integration
This is a basic discord bot that has reddit integration using the snoowrap and snoostorm node packages. It will allow you to monitor subreddits and use that data to post messages with that data to your discord server.

All you need is to setup a bot account on reddit and enter the details in the .env file as shown in .env_sample.
You will also need to setup a discord bot account.

It is currently setup for you to enter a channel ID and subreddits to monitor which will then post an embed with new submissions to that channel, you can code in your own monitoring methods such as filtering for flairs, authors etc. 

This is just to show how discord and reddit integration can work in JavaScript.
